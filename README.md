# Basic EDA on Titanic Dataset

## Project Overview

This repository showcases exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in cleaning, visualizing, and analyzing data to extract actionable insights.

## Dataset Description

This is the Titanic dataset which is publicly available on Kaggle.

## EDA Steps

- Data Import and Inspection
- Handling Missing Values and Outliers
- Feature Engineering (`pd.get_dummies` for categorical variables)
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Summary of Insights and Recommendations

## Key Findings

Summary statistics, correlation findings, and notable trends are discussed in each notebook. Insights from visualizations and recommendations are highlighted for every dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
